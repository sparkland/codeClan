#Countries Project

##Introduction
Today you will work in pairs making an application.
We have provided a start point,  but what happens next is up to you.

##Start point
The data file contains an array of hashes representing the information for each country in the world.
In functions there currently is a single function takes in the countries array, and returns the country names.  This is tested, specs/countries specs.  And the functionality is surfaced to the user via the countries runner.

#Task
In pairs we would like you to extend the application how you choose. Some examples:
  - atlas type guide, could be giving information on each country, information on continents,
    analysis such as population density
  - World report - most spoken language, gini scores
  - a game, match the capital city to the country. Name the countries in continent.
  - Personal bucket list application.
  - Translator
